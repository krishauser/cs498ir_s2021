    "## Problem 1: Planning antipodal grasps\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 1 asks to find antipodal grasps for a given object geometry, that is, line segments that a gripper could plausibly use for closing onto the geometry.  Here we will use the `AntipodalGrasp` data structure to represent these grasps, as well as the `GripperInfo` data structure defined in `cs498ir_s2021/common/gripper.py`. Read the documentation to better understand the meaning of these members.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key defining parameters of an antipodal grasp include the center of the line segment and its axis. From these parameters, you should be able to fill in its contact points and the grasp width using some geometric computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "A. First, you will fill in the `fill_in_grasp` function, which takes a center and axis and fills out the other members of the AntipodalGrasp data structure.  The [Geometry3D.rayCast_ext](http://motion.cs.illinois.edu/software/klampt/latest/pyklampt_docs/klampt.robotsim.html#klampt.Geometry3D.rayCast_ext) method used in `ray_cast_to_contact_point` will be helpful for you to retrieve the normal and position of a contact point. The subsequent cell will show the resulting grasps in red if they have no contact point, and green if they do have a contact point.  Moreover, the endpoints of the grasp will be arranged slightly outside of the object."
