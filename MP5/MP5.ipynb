As a backup, you may run code through this notebook via Binder, but be aware that you will be editing external .py files, and saving your progress is not as simple as clicking \"Save notebook state\" in this window.\n",

    "1. Double-check that your programs run without error.\n",
    "2. Send this file, all of your .py files and any other files you used in your programs on Moodle [http:/learn.illinois.edu](http:/learn.illinois.edu).\n",
    "3. If you are using any external libraries other than the ones that are indicated during the installation process, include a README file indicating which library and version you are using.  To be on the safe side, you should include a backup procedure until the graders verify that they are able to support use of that library.\n",

    "\n",
    "This problem will ask you to drive the Kinova Gen3 robot from configuration to configuration using the Klamp't sampling-based motion planning tools.  Consult the [Klamp't Motion Planning docs](http://motion.cs.illinois.edu/software/klampt/latest/pyklampt_docs/Manual-Planning.html) for more information.\n",

    "### Problem 1.A\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement `feasible_plan` in `planning.py` using the [planToConfig](http://motion.cs.illinois.edu/software/klampt/latest/pyklampt_docs/klampt.plan.robotplanning.html#klampt.plan.robotplanning.planToConfig) function of `klampt.plan.robotplanning` to generate a `MotionPlan` motion planner object configured to reach the target configuration.  Set this up so that only the links numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 are included in the moving subset. (Note: if this returns None, your start or goal were infeasible.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, repeatedly call `MotionPlan.planMore` with some small number of iterations (less than 100 or so) to invoke the planner for up to 10 seconds, or until `MotionPlan.getPath` returns a non-empty list.  You should play around with the keyword arguments as described by the documentation in order to get reasonable performance.  Try the keywords `type='sbl',perturbationRadius=0.5` to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the `problem1.py` program, you should be able to edit the robot configuration by right-clicking or dragging on it.  Every time you press 'p' or select 'Plan' from the menu, the planner will begin to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1.B\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will examine how to configure optimizing planners. In `optimizing_plan`, implement the calls necessary to repeatedly call `MotionPlan.planMore` for the time limit of 10s.  Note that you should not break the loop when a first path is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given goal configuration is a bit tricky for some of these planners to reach. In `problem1.py`, change the goal configuration from 'goal.config' to 'goal_easy.config' when PROBLEM='1b' is set.  Using the default start and the \"easy\" goal, run each of the following planner settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `type='sbl',shortcut=True,perturbationRadius=0.5`: The SBL planner followed by shortcutting.\n",
    "- `type='sbl',perturbationRadius=0.5,shortcut=True,restart=True,restartTermCond=\"{foundSolution:1,maxIters:100}\"`: The SBL planner followed by shortcutting and random restarts.\n",
    "- `type='rrt*'`: The RRT* planner.\n",
    "- `type='lazyrrg*'`: An RRT* like strategy, but which performs lazy collision checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you might find it convenient to store these settings in a Python dictionary and pass them to the `planToConfig` function as keyword arguments using the `**kwargs` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather statistics for 10 runs about the success rate and final optimized path length at the end of that 10s planning duration.  You should place this raw data in a text or CSV file.  In the space below for written answers, report the mean and standard deviation for the above settings  If you desire, you may tweak the parameter settings as well, but if you do so, please report the settings that you used to generate this data."

    "2. Retract this configuration along the approach direction, opening the gripper to a wider configuration using `gripper.set_finger_config(qgrasp,gripper.partway_open_config(1))`. Check collisions along the open and approach.\n",
    "3. Create a planner (using one of your preferred planner settings) to generate the transit path.  (You will want to fully open the gripper in the start configuration too.)\n",

    "5. Returns a triple containing the transit path, approach, and lift.\n",

    "Now, you are given a set of candidate grasps.  Design the `plan_pick_iterate` algorithm to iterate through the grasps in order of increasing score, and try sampling a feasible IK configuration and planning a feasible motion for a fixed amount of time.  If you fail, move to the next grasp.\n",

    "### Problem 3A\n",
    "\n",
    "In `place.py`, implement the `transfer_plan` function that plans a feasible transfer plan to a target configuration. A transfer motion planner must perform collision checking so that the object moves along with the robot's gripper according to the given grasp.  The easiest way to do this is to provide a callback to `extraConstraints` which will check collision between the object, the environment, and the robot.  Don't forget to avoid collision testing the object against the gripper! \n",
